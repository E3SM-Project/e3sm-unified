E3SM-Unified is a unified conda + Spack environment developed to support pre-
and post-processing workflows for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model
(E3SM). It bundles commonly used analysis, visualization, and workflow tools
into a single portable environment.

This documentation is for both **users** of the E3SM-Unified environment and
**developers** who build, test, and deploy it on supported platforms.
