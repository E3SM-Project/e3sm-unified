# The E3SM-Unified Release Workflow

Releasing a new version of E3SM-Unified is an iterative, collaborative process
involving Conda, Spack, and coordinated deployment across HPC systems. This
guide serves as a roadmap for each stage in the workflow.

Whether you're updating packages, building release candidates, or testing on
HPC platforms, this section documents the steps needed to bring a new version
of E3SM-Unified from planning to full deployment.

## Overview of the Workflow

The release process typically follows this progression:

1. **[How Conda and Spack Work Together in E3SM-Unified](conda-vs-spack.md)**
2. **[Planning Package Updates](planning-updates.md)**
3. **[Creating Release Candidates](creating-rcs/overview.md)**
4. **[Deploying on HPCs for Testing](deploying-testing.md)**
5. **[Testing Across the Ecosystem](testing-ecosystem.md)**
6. **[Finalizing the Release](finalizing-release.md)**

Each of these steps is detailed in its own page. See below for a high-level
summary.

## 1. How Conda and Spack Work Together in E3SM-Unified

Why does E3SM-Unified use both Conda and Spack? What roles do they each serve?
Before you start, it's critical to understand how these two systems work
together.

## 2. Planning Package Updates

Updates are driven by the needs of the E3SM community, typically discussed via
Confluence or GitHub. This step documents how to propose new packages or
changes to existing ones.

## 3. Creating Release Candidates

This step covers:

* Making RCs for core tools (e.g., E3SM Diags, MPAS-Analysis, zppy)
* Building an `e3sm-unified` RC

## 4. Deploying on HPCs for Testing

Before full deployment, release candidates are installed on a subset of HPC
platforms for iterative testing and validation. This stage often requires
extensive coordination and may involve debugging and extending the Spack build
workflow, updating the E3SM Spack fork, and modifying `mache` to support new
systems or changes in machine configurations.

## 5. Testing Across the Ecosystem

Testing includes everything from basic imports to full zppy workflows. This is
a collaborative effort, with the full iterative process often spanning several
weeks to a few months.

## 6. Finalizing the Release

Once all RCs pass testing:

* Make final releases of all dependencies
* Publish the final E3SM-Unified conda package
* Deploy across all supported HPC machines
