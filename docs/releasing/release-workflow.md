# Overview of the Workflow

The release process typically follows this progression:

1. **[Planning Package Updates](planning-updates.md)**
2. **[Creating Release Candidates](creating-rcs/overview.md)**
3. **[Deployment and Testing](testing/overview.md)**
4. **[Adding a New Machine](adding-new-machines.md)**
5. **[Finalizing the Release](finalizing-release.md)**
6. **[Maintaining Past Versionse](maintaining-past-versions.md)**

We begin with some background information, then each of these steps is detailed
in its own page. See below for a high-level summary.

## Backgraound: How Conda and Spack Work Together in Polaris

Why does E3SM-Unified use both Conda and Spack? What roles do they each serve?
Before you start, it's critical to understand how these two systems work
together.

## 1. Planning Package Updates

Updates are driven by the needs of the E3SM community, typically discussed via
Confluence or GitHub. This step documents how to propose new packages or
changes to existing ones.

## 2. Creating Release Candidates

This step covers:

* Making RCs for core tools (e.g., E3SM Diags, MPAS-Analysis, zppy)
* Building an `e3sm-unified` RC

## 3. Deploying and Testing on HPCs

Before full deployment, release candidates are installed on a subset of HPC
platforms for iterative testing and validation. This stage often requires
updating updating `mache` to support new systems or changes in machine
configurations, adding package versions to E3SM's Spack fork, and
troubleshooting deployment scripts.

Testing includes everything from basic imports to full `zppy` workflows. This
is a collaborative effort, with the full iterative process often spanning
several weeks to a few months.

## 4. Adding a New Machine

Most of the work for adding a new machine takes place in `mache`. Here we
provide notes on adding new HPCs that are specific to E3SM-Unified.

## 5. Finalizing the Release

Once all RCs pass testing:

* Make final releases of all dependencies
* Publish the final E3SM-Unified conda package
* Deploy across all supported HPC machines
* Announce the release to the community

## 6. Maintaining Past Versions

Older versions of E3SM-Unified sometimes require maintenance (repairs or
deletion).
